## Why

There's no typing practice tool in this project yet. A speed typing test will help users measure and improve their typing speed and accuracy through timed practice sessions.

## What Changes

- Add a browser-based typing test application using vanilla HTML/CSS/JavaScript
- Display a passage of text for the user to type
- Track typing speed in words per minute (WPM)
- Calculate and display accuracy percentage
- Show results when the test is complete

## Capabilities

### New Capabilities

- `typing-test-ui`: The user interface for the typing test, including text display, input handling, and visual feedback
- `metrics-calculation`: Calculate WPM and accuracy from user input compared to target text

### Modified Capabilities

(None - this is a new project)

## Impact

- New files: `index.html`, `style.css`, `script.js`
- No external dependencies (vanilla JS)
- Runs entirely in the browser, no server required
